## cleanup.py - File Organization Script

Personal Python script to clean and sort files within directories based on their file extensions. It organizes files into predefined categories such as **Documents**, **Images**, **Videos**, **Music**, **Archives**, **Executables**, and more. Any files that don't match these categories are moved into an **"Others"** folder. The script also removes any empty folders left behind after organizing the files.
